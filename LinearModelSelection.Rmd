```{r}
library(glmnet) # alpha = 0 is ridge, 1 is lasso
library(pls)
library(leaps)
prostate = get(load("prostate2.Rdata"))
head(prostate)
prostate$svi = as.factor(prostate$svi)
summary(prostate)
attach(prostate)
```

# Variable evaluation and comparison

```{r}
plot(prostate)
```


```{r}
plot(prostate$Cscore, prostate$lweight)
```

There are 97 data points, seven predictor variables and one response variable. There seem to be positive correlations between Cscore and lpsa as well as lcavol and lpsa.


# Forward stepwise selection

```{r}
fwd = regsubsets(Cscore~., data = prostate, nvmax = 10, method="forward")
summary(fwd)
```

```{r}

bestforward = function (response, nvmax = 19, data){
  p = length(names(data))
  k = p - 1
  nullmodel = lm(response~1)
  for (i in 2:k){
    for (i in 1:(p-k)){
      
    }
  }
}

```
